# Instacart Basket Analysis

## Project Overview**

This project was completed as part of the Data Immersion program. The aim was to support Instacart, an online grocery store, in better understanding their customer segments and purchasing behaviors. By conducting an exploratory analysis of Instacart’s open-source datasets, the goal was to derive actionable insights and inform targeted marketing strategies.

## Objectives
Instacart stakeholders wanted to answer several key business questions:
1. Sales Timing: What are the busiest days and times for orders?
2. Spending Patterns: Are there particular times of day when spending peaks?
3. Price Groupings: How can products be grouped into simple price categories for marketing?
4. Popular Products: Which product types and departments are most frequently ordered?
5. Customer Segments: How do different customer profiles (loyalty, region, demographics, family status, age/income) differ in their ordering behaviors?

## Data
- Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017 (via Kaggle)
- Customers dataset (CareerFoundry-provided for project purposes)
- Data Dictionary (Instacart-provided)

## Tools & Libraries
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python
- pandas, NumPy, os
- matplotlib

## Methodology
- Data Wrangling: Cleaning missing values, duplicates, and mixed data types.
- Data Merging: Combining multiple datasets into one unified dataset.
- Exploratory Analysis: Segmenting customers by loyalty, demographics, region, and order behavior.
- Visualization: Using bar charts, histograms, and line charts to communicate findings.
- Recommendations: Linking insights to potential marketing and sales strategies.

## Key Insights
- Peak Ordering Times: Saturday and Sunday, particularly mornings and early evenings.
- Spending Peaks: Highest between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., aligned with meal planning.
- Product Categories: Produce, dairy, snacks, and beverages are the most popular.
- Customer Segmentation:
- Loyal customers drive most orders.
- Differences observed by region (e.g., South lowest loyalty vs. Midwest highest).
- Parental status significantly affects ordering patterns.
- Price Sensitivity: Simple price groupings help target budget-conscious shoppers and premium buyers separately.

## Recommendations
- Timing-Based Campaigns:
  - Run ads during off-peak hours to balance server load.
  - Target high-spend windows (10 a.m.–6 p.m.) with premium product promotions.
- Product Bundling:
  - Create convenient bundles for snacks, beverages, and produce.
  - Offer family-focused bundles (meal kits, baby products, subscriptions).
- Targeted Marketing:
  - Differentiate campaigns by loyalty, age, family status, and region.
  - Personalize ads for health-conscious and budget-sensitive customers.
- Growth Strategy:
  - Expand in low-loyalty regions with targeted campaigns.
  - Leverage segmentation to test agri-specific and regional promotions.

## Final Takeaway
Instacart’s customer base is shaped by nuanced differences in loyalty, spending habits, life stage, and region. By adopting a targeted segmentation strategy, Instacart can move beyond mass marketing to personalized campaigns that increase engagement, improve lifetime value, and strengthen customer satisfaction.
